package Tree;

/*
Intro -:
    Tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent
    and organize data in the form of parent child relationship

    The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it
    are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and
    these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a
    recursive structure.


Terminology
-> Root
-> Chid Node
-> Parent Node
-> Sibling(means node with common parent) Node

-> Leaf Node (with 0 childern)
-> Internal Node
-> Ancestor Node
-> Descendant Node

-> Level
-> Number of edges  (size-1)
-> Height   (level-1)
-> Size  (No. of Node)


Important properties if trees
 1- Traversing in a tree is done by Depth first search and breadth first
    search algorithm
 2- It has no loop and no circuit
 3. It has no self-loop


Application of Tree data Structure -:

1. Hierarchical data Structure
2. Searching efficiency
3. Sorting
4. Dynamic Data
5. Efficient insertion and deletion
6. easy to implement


Types of Tree -:

1. BINARY TREE : Tree whose each node has either 0,1,2 childern
